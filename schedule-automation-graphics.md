## Cues

Automatically schedules graphics along with the primary content. The Graphics asset and scheduling rule are maintained as part of media content's metadata. These graphics are automatically added during the upload of the playlist.

## Now-Next-Later

Automatically schedules Now-Next-Later Graphics based on rules. The program contents are distinguished from promo or commercial contents based media type of the content. A program is identified using **Asset ID** and its segments used in the schedule. Static and Dynamic graphics can be scheduled as Now-Next-Later graphics.

### Dynamic Graphics

The text, audio and image elements specific to a content can be applied dynamically to a Graphics Template to create dynamica graphics.

## Downcounter

**Downcounter** graphics are scheduled automatically during the processing.
